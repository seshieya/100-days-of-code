# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 17, 2020

**Today's Focus**: Goals Brainstorming

**Progress**:

- Ideas for what kind of projects / goals I would like to accomplish during this challenge:
  - Ultimate goal is to improve on overall skill set in terms of designing the code and getting faster at it - in the C# language and Javascript
  - Work on some neat interactive JS solutions - perhaps some taken from here https://javascript30.com/
  - Develop a simple game by starting with some activities here: https://www.codingame.com/
    - Possible tutorials to do?: 
      - https://www.codementor.io/@dewetvanthomas/tutorial-game-loop-for-c-128ovxgrig
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOJErrCyt5A&vl=de
  - Brush up on algorithms by doing some coding interview questions: 
    - either from the Cracking the coding interview 
    - or doing some from https://leetcode.com/ (https://leetcode.com/explore/other/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge)
  - more simple coding project ideas? https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2a9ygh/1000_beginner_programming_projects_xpost/??
  - work on wallite app?
  - work on new deals site idea?
  - learn how to use unity?

- Brainstorm Session Conclusion:
  - Decided to start with working the commerce deals project that I have been thinking about recently. 
    - I wanted to create something that I would use on a daily basis, and that other people might find useful too, so this deals project meets both criteria.
    - started thinking about possible names to call the site
    - made a simple wireframe (on paper) of what the site could look like
    - decided on using React for the frontend instead of using Razor pages to try it out in ASP.NET Core

### Day 1: May 18, 2020

**Today's Focus**: Integrate with external API
**Progress**: 
- Tried hooking up a quick console app to work with external API unsuccessfully. For some reason the console app launches on a random port, which the Gmail API cannot authenticate with because the port is not a valid redirect URL
- Need to troubleshoot more tomorrow

**Links to work**: None for today as just testing with a console app for now

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
